This project is in a preliminary stage so some things are unfinished. Therefore, please don't comment on the comments (I know they are bad), some classes are not yet added to the application (you can run some of the tests if you want), and styling (with css) is almost non-existent. Because of this, please don't be too specific in these areas and try to provide more helpful feedback instead (like general GUI layout or functionality).

To run the VOXSpell program, follow these steps (assuming you are using UG4 linux)

1. Open a command line interpreter / terminal

2. Set the current directory to be the directory that these files are found in 

3. Run this command in the terminal:
bash Runner.sh

4. If that doesn't work, then you are not in UG4. In that case, change the script file to use your own jdk. If you don't have a jdk, download one from Oracle or run this in UG4
