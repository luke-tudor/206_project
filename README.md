To run the VOXSpell program, follow these steps (assuming you are using UG4 linux)

1. Open a command line interpreter / terminal

2. Set the current directory to be the directory that these files are found in 

3. Run this command in the terminal:
bash Runner.sh

4. If that doesn't work, try the following command:
/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_91/bin/java -cp bin spellAid.ui.SpellingAid

5. If that doesn't work, please change the JDK path used in the script file to a JDK that is downloaded on your computer. If you don't have a JDK installed, download one from the internet.
